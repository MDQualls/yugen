# Yugen Farm Blog @ [www.yugenfarm.com](https://www.yugenfarm.com)

A blogging application which was built to document our journey from Oklahoma to New Mexico and beyond.  The hope is that this will serve as a historical reference for ourselves and somewhat of a guide for others hoping to make the transition from city life to farm life.

This application is still in the feature development stage and I expect that continuous development will continue for several more months.  In order to get the applciation in place quickly so that my wife could start adding articles, some necessary enhancements and architectual improvements are still in development.  Additional features will include adding more functionality to the CMS, improving the schema, customizing the CSS and implementing SASS to enhance the client side experience, further abstraction of the architecture, and ehnacement of error logging and handling.
